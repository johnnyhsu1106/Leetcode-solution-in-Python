'''
Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s,
find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s.
If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

For example, given the array [2,3,1,2,4,3] and s = 7,
the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

If you have figured out the O(n) solution,
try coding another solution of which the time complexity is O(n log n).

        The most common way is to use two for loop. However, time complexity is too hight.
